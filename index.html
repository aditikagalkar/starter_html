        <p>
          Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days
          lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has
          gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long
          as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to
          avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like
          skills in chasing them.
        </p>
        <p>
          At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon
          suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on
          a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a
          ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.
        </p>

        <h2>Pluto</h2>
        <img src="images/pluto.jpg" width="400" alt="White dog looking up." />
        <p>
          Pluto is a five year old rescue dog of an unknown breed. He was found
          wandering alone and taken to the Valley Humane Society where he found
          his new family. From a young age, Pluto always had a special
          personality, he was known for being very very lazy! He spends most of
          his time staring out the window to keep watch of his house. Don’t let
          the laziness fool you because Pluto defends his family from the
          mailman and squirrels every single day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from his job as defender of the house, Pluto likes to have fun.
          Pluto’s favorite part of the day is his daily walk. Sometimes he even
          gets to go to the park and meet his neighbors. He also loves his toy
          duck, and only his toy duck. As a dog, it's in his nature to hunt and
          so he makes sure to get some practice with his toy duck.
        </p>

          Brul is a 2yr old Maine coon cat. She prefers to spend his days lying
          in the bed. She enjoys watching outside from the window as long as
          there are no loud noises and bugs outside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brul loves walks on the beach and taking sun naps on a warm summer
          day. Brul is a playful cat but enjoys having slow, relaxed days at the
          same time. She hates grooming and bathing.
