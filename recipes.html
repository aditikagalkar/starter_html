        <h2>Double Chocolate Cookies</h2>

        <p>
          My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at
          Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her
          siblings. They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.
          Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.

        <span>Category: Main Dish</span>
        <img src="images/Japanese Chicken Curry.jpg" width="400" alt="plate of curry and rice">
        <p>Unlike Indian or Thai curry, Japanese curry is more savory than spicy. It’s an exemplary comfort food and one of the most-loved home-cooked dishes in Japan.</p>
        <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>skinless, boneless chicken breast</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
          <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper</li>
          <li>water</li>
          <li>1 package curry sauce mix</li>
          <li>1 can peas</li>
          <li>5 new potatoes, halved</li>
          <li>1 package sliced cremini mushrooms</li>
          <li>2 medium carrots, chopped</li>
          <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
          <li>2 cups jasmine rice</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Recipe Steps </h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Place chicken in a large, deep skillet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper on both sides. Add 1/3 cup water to the pan, cover, and cook over medium heat until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes.</li>
          <li>While chicken is cooking, pour 2 cups water into a microwave-safe bowl. Break curry sauce mix into pieces and add to water. Heat in the microwave on high for 3 1/2 minutes; remove and stir until sauce mix has completely dissolved.</li>
          <li>Remove chicken from the skillet. Cut into cubes, return to the skillet, and pour curry sauce over top. Stir in peas, potatoes, mushrooms, carrots, and onion. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
          <li>Meanwhile, bring remaining water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
          <li>Scoop rice into bowls and serve curry on top.</li>
